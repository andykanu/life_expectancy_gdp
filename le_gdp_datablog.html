    What are your first impressions looking at the visualized data?

    Which countries' bars changes the most?
    What years are there the biggest changes in the data?
    Which country has had the least change in GDP over time?
    How do countries compare to one another?
    Now that you can see the both bar charts, what do you think about the relationship between GDP and life expectancy?
    Can you think of any reasons that the data looks like this for particular countries?

FACETGRID GDP

    Which country moves the most along the X axis over the years?
    Which country moves the most along the Y axis over the years?
    Is this surprising?
    Do you think these scatter plots are easy to read? Maybe there's a way to plot that!

    FACETGRID LEABY
    What are your first impressions looking at the visualized data?

    Which countries' line changes the most?
    What years are there the biggest changes in the data?
    Which country has had the least change in life expectancy over time?
    Can you think of any reasons that the data looks like this for particular countries?

Q.s which countries have highest and lowest GDP?
Q.s which countries have highest and lowest LEABY?

Based on the visualization, choose one part the data to research a little further so you can add some real world context to the visualization. You can choose anything you like, or use the example question below.

What happened in China between in the past 10 years that increased the GDP so drastically?
Use the content you have created in this Jupyter notebook to create a blog post reflecting on this data. Include the following visuals in your blogpost:

    The violin plot of the life expectancy distribution by country
    The facet grid of scatter graphs mapping GDP as a function Life Expectancy by country
    The facet grid of line graphs mapping GDP by country
    The facet grid of line graphs mapping Life Expectancy by country

We encourage you to spend some time customizing the color and style of your plots! Remember to use plt.savefig("filename.png") to save your figures as a .png file.

When authoring your blog post, here are a few guiding questions to guide your research and writing:

    How do you think the histories and the cultural values of each country relate to its GDP and life expectancy?
    What would have helped make the project data more reliable? What were the limitations of the dataset?
    Which graphs better illustrate different relationships??

      <h1>Life Expectancy & GDP</h1>
      <h2>Initial findings</h2>
      <h3>GDP</h3>
      <p>
        GDP by country follows expected economic lines, with the US out in
        front, followed by China, the world's second-largest economy. Germany,
        Europe's largest economy comes next. Mexico, which has benefited from
        the relocation of several US industries remains ahead of Chile, which
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile" target="_blank"
          >is one of the leading economies of South America.</a
        >
        Zimbabwe, which went through economic convulsions in the early 2000s,
        achieving an
        <a

          >unemployment rate of 94% in 2008</a
        >, unsurprisingly fares worst of the countries studied.

      />
      <h3>Life expectancy</h3>
      <!-- Section on life expectancy bar chart-->
      <p>
        The relationship between GDP and life-expectancy is low, with Germany
        and Chile having the highest life-expectancy, but all countries apart
        from Zimbabwe have similar life expectancies. Zimbabwe's relatively poor
        performance can be attributed in part
        <a
          href="https://www.who.int/workforcealliance/countries/zwe/en/"
          target="_blank"
          >to the wider economic malaise, which has led to under-investment in
          healthcare infrastructure</a
        >
        and the loss of trained staff from the sector.

      <!--Section on life expectancy violin plot-->
      <p>
        Looking more closely at the spread of life expectancy, we can see that
        in all countries, apart from Zimbabwe, life expectancy has been
        reasonably stable. China has also seen a more dramatic change than other
        economies, which may be linked to China's growing middle class and
        economic development.<br /><br />
        In Zimbabwe, the years studied have seen unprecedented challenges for
        the economy, with the first decade of the new millennium having seen the
        onset of the
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >'Zimbabwe Crisis'</a
        >, a confluence of botched land reform, economic mismanagement and
        hyperinflation, which reached 271 million percent between 2007 and 2008.
        The already small, ill-functioning economy shrunk by 30% between 2000
        and 2010. Over 2 million jobs were lost in the periods studied. Along
        with these economic factors, Zimbabwe has been hard hit by AIDS, with
        <a href="https://www.who.int/hiv/HIVCP_ZWE.pdf" target="_blank"
          >roughly a quarter of the adult population</a
        >
        believed to have HIV/AIDS in 2003. In 2005, only 23,000 of an estimated
        321,000 people in need, were receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS. Following
        this devastation, real progress has been made more recently in health
        outcomes, which have led to great improvements in life expectancy.

      <h2>Tracking changes by year</h2>
      <h3>GDP</h3>
      <p>
        The key trend of the years 2000 to 2015 was the economc rise of China.
        China's economic output was smaller than that of Germany at the turn of
        the millennium, since when it has accelerated industrialization and
        development to race into the position of second-largest global economy.
        The US economy has also grown significantly in this time, but not at the
        same rate as China's. China is expected to overtake the US in the coming
        decades.

      <h3>Life expectancy</h3>
      <p>
        In all countries other than Zimbabwe, life expectancy grew modestly
        across the period studied. In Zimbabwe, life expectancy fell during the
        'Zimbabwe crisis' of the early 2000s. Zimbabwe had the dubious honour of
        having the

        in 2006, before recovering dramatically, albeit still lagging behind
        every other country in this study. This increase in life expectancy
