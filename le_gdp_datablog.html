BAR CHARTS 
What do you notice about the two bar charts? Do they look similar?

#Little correlation between GDP and life expectancy. 
Zimbabwe bottom of both but it's notable that the four other countries have similar LEABY to US despite inferior GDP.

VIOLIN PLOT 
xWhat do you notice about this distribution? Which country's life expactancy has changed the most?

SEABORN CHARTS
    What are your first impressions looking at the visualized data?

    Which countries' bars changes the most?
    What years are there the biggest changes in the data?
    Which country has had the least change in GDP over time?
    How do countries compare to one another?
    Now that you can see the both bar charts, what do you think about the relationship between GDP and life expectancy?
    Can you think of any reasons that the data looks like this for particular countries?

FACETGRID GDP

    Which country moves the most along the X axis over the years?
    Which country moves the most along the Y axis over the years?
    Is this surprising?
    Do you think these scatter plots are easy to read? Maybe there's a way to plot that!

    FACETGRID LEABY
    What are your first impressions looking at the visualized data?

    Which countries' line changes the most?
    What years are there the biggest changes in the data?
    Which country has had the least change in life expectancy over time?
    Can you think of any reasons that the data looks like this for particular countries?

Q.s which countries have highest and lowest GDP?
Q.s which countries have highest and lowest LEABY?

Based on the visualization, choose one part the data to research a little further so you can add some real world context to the visualization. You can choose anything you like, or use the example question below.

What happened in China between in the past 10 years that increased the GDP so drastically?
Use the content you have created in this Jupyter notebook to create a blog post reflecting on this data. Include the following visuals in your blogpost:

    The violin plot of the life expectancy distribution by country
    The facet grid of scatter graphs mapping GDP as a function Life Expectancy by country
    The facet grid of line graphs mapping GDP by country
    The facet grid of line graphs mapping Life Expectancy by country

We encourage you to spend some time customizing the color and style of your plots! Remember to use plt.savefig("filename.png") to save your figures as a .png file.

When authoring your blog post, here are a few guiding questions to guide your research and writing:

    How do you think the histories and the cultural values of each country relate to its GDP and life expectancy?
    What would have helped make the project data more reliable? What were the limitations of the dataset?
    Which graphs better illustrate different relationships??
