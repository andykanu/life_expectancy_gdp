      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Reviewing data for an economy from each major region, tracking life expectancy and GDP, could we say whether there was a strong association between life expectancy and GDP? The countries reviewed were: <ul><li>United States</li><li>China</li><li>Mexico</li><li>Germany</li><li>Zimbabwe</li></ul></p>
      <h2>Initial findings</h2>
      <h3>GDP</h3>
      <p>
        GDP by country follows expected economic lines, with the US out in
        front, followed by China, the world's second-largest economy. Germany,
        Europe's largest economy comes next. Mexico, which has benefited from
        the relocation of several US industries remains ahead of Chile, which
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile" target="_blank"
          >is one of the leading economies of South America.</a
        >
        Zimbabwe, which went through economic convulsions in the early 2000s,
        achieving an
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Zimbabwe"
          target="_blank"
          >unemployment rate of 94% in 2008</a
        >, unsurprisingly fares worst of the countries studied.
      </p>

      <h3>Life expectancy</h3>
      <!-- Section on life expectancy bar chart-->
      <p>
        The relationship between GDP and life-expectancy is low, with Germany
        and Chile having the highest life-expectancy, but all countries apart
        from Zimbabwe have similar life expectancies. Zimbabwe's relatively poor
        performance can be attributed in part
        <a
          href="https://www.who.int/workforcealliance/countries/zwe/en/"
          target="_blank"
          >to the wider economic malaise, which has led to under-investment in
          healthcare infrastructure</a
        >
        and the loss of trained staff from the sector.

      <p>
        Looking more closely at the spread of life expectancy, we can see that
        in all countries, apart from Zimbabwe, life expectancy has been
        reasonably stable. China has also seen a more dramatic change than other
        economies, which may be linked to China's growing middle class and
        economic development.<br /><br />
        In Zimbabwe, the years studied have seen unprecedented challenges for
        the economy, with the first decade of the new millennium having seen the
        onset of the
        <a
          href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320036241_In_Search_of_Development_Zimbabwe_Examplar_2000_to_2015"
          target="_blank"
          >'Zimbabwe Crisis'</a
        >, a confluence of botched land reform, economic mismanagement and
        hyperinflation, which reached 271 million percent between 2007 and 2008.
        The already small, ill-functioning economy shrunk by 30% between 2000
        and 2010. Over 2 million jobs were lost in the periods studied. Along
        with these economic factors, Zimbabwe has been hard hit by AIDS, with
        <a href="https://www.who.int/hiv/HIVCP_ZWE.pdf" target="_blank"
          >roughly a quarter of the adult population</a
        >
        believed to have HIV/AIDS in 2003. In 2005, only 23,000 of an estimated
        321,000 people in need, were receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS. Following
        this devastation, real progress has been made more recently in health
        outcomes, which have led to great improvements in life expectancy.

      <h2>Tracking changes by year</h2>
      <h3>GDP</h3>
      <p>
        The key trend of the years 2000 to 2015 was the economc rise of China.
        China's economic output was smaller than that of Germany at the turn of
        the millennium, since when it has accelerated industrialization and
        development to race into the position of second-largest global economy.
        The US economy has also grown significantly in this time, but not at the
        same rate as China's. China is expected to overtake the US in the coming
        decades.

      <h3>Life expectancy</h3>
      <p>
        In all countries other than Zimbabwe, life expectancy grew modestly
        across the period studied. In Zimbabwe, life expectancy fell during the
        'Zimbabwe crisis' of the early 2000s. Zimbabwe had the dubious honour of
        having the

        in 2006, before recovering dramatically, albeit still lagging behind
        every other country in this study. This increase in life expectancy

      <h3>Trends</h3>
      <p>
        Looking more closely at the data, year by year, we can see the dramatic
        improvement in Zimbabwe's life expectancy in the latter half of the
        period studied. China's dramatic rise through the ranks of GDP can also
        be seen as it emerges from the cluster of smaller economies to track
        closer to the US across the years.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>While life-expectancy increased in all of the economies studied across the first fifteen years of the millennium, the change in life expectancy in Zimbabwe was an outlier. Zimbabwe's GDP remains flat across the period, but it went through a reduction followed by dramatic increase in life-expectancy. Overall, while we can say that there is some association between life expectancy and GDP in functioning economies, this relationship was broken in the Zimbabwe Crisis, as the country went through economic and developmental catastrophe, becoming close to a failed state. As governance became more stable, while overall GDP did not increase dramatically, the health outcomes of citizens and life expectancy were transformed. </p>
